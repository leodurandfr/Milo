FeedRefreshDetails
==================

Options for how often Taddy checks a podcast feed for updates.

```
enum FeedRefreshPriority {
  WEBSUB
  HIGH
  MEDIUM
  REGULAR
  LOW
  INACTIVE
  NEVER
}
```


`WEBSUB` - Feed is checked immediately for updates (within 5 mins, usually much sooner). Taddy gets notified of a change to the podcast feed via a [WebSub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSub) notification.

`HIGH` - Feed is checked every 2 hours. This is used for very popular podcasts that do not have WebSub support

`MEDIUM` - Feed is checked every 6 hours. This is used for popular podcasts that do not have WebSub support

`REGULAR` - Feed is checked every day. This is the most common queue for podcasts that do not support WebSub.

`INACTIVE` - Feed is checked once a week. This is used for podcast feeds that have not been updated in over a year.

`LOW` - Feed is checked once a month. This is used for podcast feeds that throw an error.

`NEVER` - Feed is no longer checked for updates. This is only used in the rare circumstance a podcast violates our [distribution policy](https://taddy.org/terms-of-service/distribution-policy).

If a feed has been set as LOW, INACTIVE, or NEVER priority, you can check the reason why:

```
enum FeedRefreshPriorityReason {
  INACTIVE_FOR_OVER_1_YEAR
  DUPLICATE_FEED
  ERROR_PARSING_FEED
  FEED_URL_NOT_WORKING
  PRIVATE_PODCAST_FEED
  VIOLATES_TADDY_DISTRIBUTION_POLICY 
}
```


`INACTIVE_FOR_OVER_1_YEAR` - Feed has not had any updates in the last 12 months

`DUPLICATE_FEED` - There is another feed in our database that links to the same content

`ERROR_PARSING_FEED` - Error parsing document when trying to check the feed for new updates

`FEED_URL_NOT_WORKING` - Error when trying to load the feed url (404 error, etc)

`PRIVATE_PODCAST_FEED` - This is a private Patreon or Supercast feed that is not meant for the public

`VIOLATES_TADDY_DISTRIBUTION_POLICY` - The feed has been reviewed by a Taddy staff member and is in violation of [our distribution policy](https://taddy.org/terms-of-service/distribution-policy).
