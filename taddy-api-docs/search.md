By default, `search` will return the results that best match the exact term you pass it. However, you may want to prioritize results from popular podcasts over an exact match.

4\. When searching for podcasts with the term "Dentist" with sortBy: `EXACTNESS` (default) it will rank podcasts that have the exact title or description "Dentist" highest.

However, if you use sortBy: `POPULARITY` it will give more weight to the podcast’s popularity over an exact match. This is good if you care about more popular (and usually higher quality) results over an exact match.

```
{
  search(term:"Dentist", filterForTypes:PODCASTSERIES, sortBy:POPULARITY){
    searchId
    podcastSeries{
      uuid
      name
      description
    }
  }
}
```


**Note:** See Sorting documentation for more details.

#### [](#1ab24604b11580b6ba02e8eddeab9c07 "Matching ")Matching

You have the ability to match the results being returned from `EXACT_PHRASE` (Strict), `ALL_TERMS`, or `MOST_TERMS`(Least strict & default).

5\. Searching "Jim Farley" episodes with matchBy: `EXACT_PHRASE` requires the exact phrase to be in the search results (which makes this option useful when searching for someone’s name)

```
{
  search(term:"Jim Farley", filterForTypes:PODCASTEPISODE, matchBy:EXACT_PHRASE, sortBy:POPULARITY){
    searchId
    podcastEpisodes{
      uuid
      name
      description
      audioUrl
      podcastSeries{
	      uuid
	      name
	    }
    }
  }
}
```


6\. Searching "Music Theory Jazz" episodes with matchBy: `ALL_TERMS` requires all passed in words to be present.

```
{
  search(term:"Music Theory Jazz", filterForTypes:PODCASTEPISODE, matchBy:ALL_TERMS, sortBy:POPULARITY){
    searchId
    podcastEpisodes{
      uuid
      name
      description
      audioUrl
      podcastSeries{
	      uuid
	      name
	    }
    }
  }
}
```
